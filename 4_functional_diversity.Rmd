**Functional diversity did not vary across the fire severity gradient.** Calculated values for each site are displayed for four indices of functional diversity: functional richness (FRic), functional divergence (FDiv), functional evenness (FEve), and functional dispersion (FDis). Means and standard deviations are shown for the three fire severity treatments: unburned (unb), low-moderate severity (mod), and high severity (high). Functional diversity indices were calculated using four ecologically relevant traits: diet, body size, activity time, and foraging mode. None of the differences in functional diversity between treatments were significant by ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis ($\alpha$ = 0.5).

- Results were the same when two aspects of foraging mode (foraging height and degree of fossoriality) were split and equally weighted with the other three traits.

                      ylab = 'FDis')

##Individual Components of Functional Diversity


###Biomass

```{r biomass data frames, include=FALSE}

# Data frame of total biomass at each site

biomass <- smamms_n %>%
  full_join(pantheria, by = 'binomial') %>% # add PanTHERIA data
  select(site, severity, binomial, cpue, body_mass) %>% 
  mutate(biomass = cpue*body_mass) # calcuate total biomass per species, per site

biomass_total <- biomass %>% 
  group_by(site, severity) %>% 
  summarize(biomass_total = sum(biomass)) # calculate total biomass at each site, summed across species

```


```{r total biomass across severities kruskal-wallis, eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}

# Does the total biomass at each site vary across a fire severity gradient?

# Explore the data distribution

# Make histograms for each treatment
biomass_hist <- ggplot(biomass_total, aes(x = biomass_total)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  facet_wrap(~severity)

biomass_hist

# Make qqplots for each treatment
biomass_qq <- ggplot(biomass_total, aes(sample = biomass_total)) +
  geom_qq() +
  facet_wrap(~severity)

biomass_qq

# Histograms look a little funky because sample size is so small
# qq-plots look weird and swoopy, pluass the mod distribution is really disjunct
# n=9 for each severity, so cannot use CLT to justify normality



# Explore variance
variances <- biomass_total %>% 
  group_by(severity) %>% 
  summarize(
    variance = var(biomass_total)
  )

variances

# Variances are WAY different (>4x)
# Cannot satisfy assumptions of ANOVA



# Test for significant differences in means

# Kruskal Wallis
biomass_kw <- kruskal.test(biomass_total ~ severity, data = biomass_total)

biomass_kw

# p>0.05, so there is no sig difference in means

```

**Increase of total biomass was not significant across the fire severity gradient.** Mean total site biomass increased with fire severity, but the differences between treatments was not significant(Kruskal-Wallis test, (chi square (2) = 1.7, p = 0.4, n = 9 for each). Biomass data from PanTHERIA.

- Results are the same using PHYLACINE body size data
- Outliers are sites that had a lot of ground squirrels

```{r biomass boxplot, echo=FALSE}

# Box and whisker plot of the mean of total site biomass across severities

colors <- c('darkgreen', 'orange', 'red')
xlabs <- c('Unburned', 'Moderate Severity', 'High Severity')

total_biomass_box <- ggplot(biomass_total,
                            aes(x = severity, y = biomass_total)) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(fill = severity)) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = colors) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = 'Fire Severity',
       y = 'Total biomass (g)') +
  theme(legend.position = 'NA') +
  scale_x_discrete(labels = xlabs)

total_biomass_box

```

**Total biomass by species across the fire severity gradient.** Total biomass summed across sites for each severity, with the proportion contributed by each species. Increases in biomass were mainly driven by *P. maniculatus* and *O. beecheyi*.

- Strange that even though the mean biomass did not change between severities, the total biomass was much higher for mod and high severities (skewed by ground squirrel outliers)

```{r biomass column graph, fig.width=6, fig.height=4, echo=FALSE}

# Column graph of biomass by species for each fire severity

biomass_col <- ggplot(biomass, aes(x = severity, y = biomass,
                                   fill = binomial)) +
  geom_col() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = 'Fire Severity',
       y = 'Biomass (g)',
       fill = 'Species')

biomass_col

```


###Diet

**Abundance by feeding guild across the fire severity gradient.** All three treatments were dominated by generalist species.

- Categorical feeding guild (herbivore, omnivore, carnivore, insectivore) was not used in functional diversity calculations
 
```{r feeding guild col graph, echo=FALSE}

# Column graph of feeding guild by fire severity

guild <- smamms_n %>% 
  full_join(traits, by = 'binomial') %>% 
  group_by(severity, guild) %>% 
  summarize(n = sum(cpue))

guild_col <- ggplot(guild, aes(x = severity, y = n,
                               fill = guild)) +
  geom_col() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = 'Fire severity',
       y = 'Number of individuals',
       fill = 'Feeding guild')

guild_col

```


```{r diet data frame, include=FALSE}

# Data frame of TOTAL abundance per species (summed across sites): use to order binomial factors

total_spp_n <- smamms %>% 
  group_by(binomial) %>% 
  summarize(n = length(binomial)) %>% 
  arrange(-n)

# Data frame of abundance of each diet type by site and species, weighted for biomass

diet <- full_join(smamms_n, traits, by = 'binomial') %>% 
  full_join(pantheria, by = 'binomial') %>% 
  select(severity, site, binomial, cpue, seeds, fruits, veg, fungi, inverts, verts, body_mass) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  mutate(binomial = factor(binomial, total_spp_n$binomial),
         biomass = cpue*body_mass, # calculate total biomass per species at each site
         seeds = seeds*biomass/100, # weight diet proportions by biomass
         fruits = fruits*biomass/100,
         veg = veg*biomass/100,
         fungi = fungi*biomass/100,
         inverts = inverts*biomass/100,
         verts = verts*biomass/100) %>% 
  select(severity, site, binomial, seeds, fruits, veg, fungi, inverts, verts) %>% 
  gather(key = diet_type, value = n, 4:9)

# Data frame summed by severity, species, and diet type

diet_sev <- diet %>% 
  group_by(severity, binomial, diet_type) %>% 
  summarize(total = sum(n))

# Data frame summed by site and diet type

diet_site <- diet %>%
  group_by(site, diet_type, severity) %>% 
  summarize(total = sum(n))

```


```{r diet npmv, eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}

# Data frame summed by site and diet type, wide format

diet_spread <- diet_site %>% 
  spread(key = diet_type, value = total)
  
# Non-parametric comparison of multivariate samples (package npmv)
# Non-parametric equivalent of MANOVA

nonpartest(fruits|fungi|inverts|seeds|veg|verts ~ severity,
           diet_spread,
           plots = FALSE)

# p>0.05 so there is no difference between groups

```

**The total biomass consuming each diet item did not vary across the fire severity gradient.** Differences between treatments the total biomass (in grams, summed across species) consuming each type of diet item were not significant (nonparametric one-way ANOVA-type multivariate test F(3.2, 38.5) = 1.1, p = 0.4).

- For each diet type (seeds, fruits, other vegetation, fungi, invertebrates, vertebrates), total contributing biomass was calculated for each site using the following formula: $\sum_{i=1}^n biomass_i * proportion_i$
    - *biomass~i~* = total biomass (g) for each species *i* at each site
    - *proportion~i~* = proportion (%) of each diet type consumed by each species *i* (determined from field guides and species accounts)
- I incorporated biomass in order to sum across species, since larger animals presumable eat more than smaller animals (and I was interested in the differences in total food resources consumed)

```{r diet jitter plots, fig.height=4, fig.width=6, echo=FALSE}

# Jitter plots

diet_jitter <- ggline(diet_site, x = 'severity', y = 'total',
                      add = c('mean_se', 'jitter'),
                      facet.by = 'diet_type', scale = 'free')

diet_jitter

```


**Mosaic plot of community diet across fire severities.** Proportion of total biomass (summed across sites) that consumed each diet type by species for each severity. Although the overall proportion of biomass consuming each diet type remained consistent between treatments, the species contributing to the biomass consuming each diet type varied.

- Total biomass was calculated similarly to above, but summed by severity instead of species: for each severity, total contributing biomass was calculated for each diet type and species using the following formula: $\sum_{i=1}^n biomass_i * proportion$
    - *biomass~i~* = total biomass (g) for each species at each site *i*
    - *proportion* = proportion (%) of each diet type consumed by each species (determined from field guides and species accounts)

```{r diet mosaic plot, fig.width=8, fig.height=4, echo=FALSE}

# Mosaic plot

xlabs <- c('Vertebrates', 'Vegetation', 'Seeds', 'Invertebrates', 'Fungi', 'Fruits')

diet_col <- ggplot(data = diet_sev) +
  geom_mosaic(aes(weight = total, x = product(diet_type), fill = binomial),
              color = 'black',
              lwd = 0.5,
              offset = 0) + 
  scale_y_productlist(breaks=c(0, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, 1),
                      labels=c('0', '25', '50', '75', '100')) +
  labs(x = 'Biomass proportion by diet type (%)',
       y = 'Biomass proportion by species (%)',
       fill = 'Species') +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(panel.grid.major = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.minor = element_blank()) +
  coord_flip() +
  facet_grid(rows = vars(severity),
             scale = 'free',
             labeller = as_labeller(c('unb' = 'Unburned',
                                      'mod' = 'Moderate',
                                      'high' = 'High')))

diet_col

```


###Foraging mode

**Abundance by foraging height across fire severity treatments.** All severities were dominated by scansorial species.

- 0 = fully terrestrial
- 1 = scansorial - lower canopy
- 2 = scansorial - upper canopy
- 3 = fully arboreal (no representatives in our data)

```{r foraging height col graph, echo=FALSE}

# Column graph of foraging height by fire severity

height <- smamms_n %>% 
  full_join(traits, by = 'binomial') %>% 
  group_by(severity, arboreal) %>% 
  summarize(n = sum(cpue))

height_col <- ggplot(height, aes(x = severity, y = n,
                                 fill = arboreal)) +
  geom_col() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = 'Fire severity',
       y = 'Number of individuals',
       fill = 'Foraging Height')

height_col

```

**Abundance by degree of fossoriality across fire severity treatments.** All severities were dominated by non-fossorial species.

- 0 = non-fossorial
- 1 = semi-fossorial (sometimes forages underground)
- 2 = semi-fossorial (sometimes forages and caches food underground)
- 3 = fully fossorial (no representatives in our data)

```{r fossoriality col graph, echo=FALSE}

# Column graph of degree of fossoriality by fire severity

foss <- smamms_n %>% 
  full_join(traits, by = 'binomial') %>% 
  group_by(severity, fossorial) %>% 
  summarize(n = sum(cpue))

foss_col <- ggplot(foss, aes(x = severity, y = n,
                             fill = fossorial)) +
  geom_col() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = 'Fire severity',
       y = 'Number of individuals',
       fill = 'Degree of Fossoriality')

foss_col

```



###Activity time

**Abundance by activity time across fire severity treatments.** All severities were dominated by nocturnal species.

```{r activity time col graph, echo=FALSE}

# Column graph of activity time by fire severity

activity <- smamms_n %>% 
  full_join(traits, by = 'binomial') %>% 
  group_by(severity, activity) %>% 
  summarize(n = sum(cpue))

activity_col <- ggplot(activity, aes(x = severity, y = n,
                                     fill = activity)) +
  geom_col() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = 'Fire severity',
       y = 'Number of individuals',
       fill = 'Activity Time')
